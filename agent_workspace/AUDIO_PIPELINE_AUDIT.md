# Audio Pipeline Audit — Baseline (2026-10-30)

Read-only audit for docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-30-audio-pipeline-benchmark.md.
Compiles already-measured results; nothing here was re-run.

### The four failure categories, and what already has a real number

**1. Score-reading failures (Claude vision transcribing a photographed/PDF score into notes)**
Real, measured this session on piece 2243 (12/8 Violin): 0/20 exact-measure accuracy, but 30.7% pitch accuracy / 21.6% rhythm accuracy at note level (`modal_worker/score_detailed_metrics.py`, scored from `modal_worker/probe_result_2243.json`). A real bug (compound-meter beat convention) was found and fixed (commit `0b7889d`, deployed). Separate, ongoing investigation — out of scope for THIS plan, which is audio-side only. See `agent_workspace/AGENT_TASKS.md`'s "Track A" entry.

**2. Audio-transcription failures (CREPE pitch detection, in isolation from any score)**
Already measured and fixed. `modal_worker/validate_pitch_against_tinysol.py` ran the real `run_pitch_tracking` against TinySOL (Cella et al. 2020, CC-BY 4.0) — 2,224 real isolated, individually-labeled notes across 13 orchestral instruments. Round 1 (before fix): 60.7% correct, 37.0% missed, concentrated in quiet (pp) dynamics and specifically Violin/Viola. Root cause: the breath-noise gate used an absolute amplitude threshold instead of a per-take-relative one (see Obsidian `Fixes/Fix — Breath-noise gate was an absolute amplitude threshold.md`). After the fix: **95.6% correct overall, pp 96.2%, Violin 94.7%, Viola 96.8%, precision-when-detected 96.4% (unchanged — this was always a recall problem, never a wrong-pitch problem).**
Real, open gap this corpus explicitly cannot cover: TinySOL's notes are isolated, not played against a score — it validates pitch detection, not alignment (next section), and it has no corpus for the false-positive side of the breath-noise gate (admitting real noise as a note).

**3. Alignment failures (DTW matching a detected audio event to the right score measure)**
Already measured and substantially improved, with a documented, explicit "stop tuning" decision on what's left. `modal_worker/validate_alignment_against_musicnet.py` runs the real `run_pitch_tracking` + `dtw_align_to_score` against MusicNet (Zenodo doi:10.5281/zenodo.5120004) — 20 scored solo Violin/Cello/Flute Bach pieces (4 of 24 excluded by `calibrate_assumptions()`'s own sanity check), 22,095 note-events. Original baseline: 46.7% correct, sharply bimodal (83-95% on 8 pieces, 0-3% on 9 pieces). Root cause, confirmed via detected/true event-count ratio: catastrophic failures are slow/legato passages where CREPE's onset detector fires spurious extra onsets within one sustained note (vibrato, bow noise), breaking the pitch-only DTW cost function's warping path. Three shipped fixes since (rest-anchored segmentation, within-segment pitch-jump detection, local-outlier rejection) moved the real 20-piece number **46.7% → 55.7% → 63.7% → 65.4%** (current, as of 2026-10-22). Five further tuning attempts on the remaining over-counting pieces (2220, 2241, 2296, 2204, parts of 2242) were each tried and reverted — a 2026-10-15 decision in `agent_workspace/AGENT_TASKS.md` explicitly says **stop tuning this mechanism; the remaining gap needs either a new idea or a real VAD/onset model, not another threshold variant.** Owner's target is 80%+ on most/all pieces — not yet reached, and not this plan's job to chase further (see Task 3's scope note).

**4. Final feedback-generation failures (Gemini's `evaluate_with_gemini` authoring flags from audio+video+score; Claude's `compare_and_coach_claude` fusing those with CREPE/DTW evidence into the student-facing flags)**
**No existing harness measures this against ground truth at all.** `modal_worker/score_against_annotations.py` computes precision/recall from real teacher annotations, but `agent_workspace/ACCURACY_BASELINE.md` confirms zero teacher annotations exist on any of 199 real production takes, and this environment has no service-role DB access to harvest them even if they existed — that path is fully blocked, independent of this plan. This is the real, unaddressed gap, and the one new thing this plan builds toward.

### Execution-path diagram (score → audio → flags)

```
photo/PDF score ──> read_score_notes_claude (3x Claude vision + Audiveris + resolution)
                     -> score {"measures": [...], "time_signature": ...}
                     (score-reading: see category 1 above, separate plan)
recording (wav) ──> run_pitch_tracking(wav_bytes, guide_times, instrument)
                     -> events: [{"pitches": [...], "time_sec": ..., ...}, ...]
                     (category 2 above)
events + score ───> dtw_align_to_score(events, score, start_measure, beats_per_measure, end_measure)
                     -> aligned: [{..., "measure": N, "time_sec": ...}, ...]
                     (category 3 above; flatten_score_notes supplies DTW's score_seq)
video/audio + score ─> evaluate_with_gemini(file_uri, mime_type, instrument, ..., score_pages=[...])
                     -> gemini_assessment: {"intonation_issues": [...], "rhythm_issues": [...], ...}
                     (category 4, Gemini half)
aligned + gemini_assessment + score ─> compare_and_coach_claude(score, aligned, alignment_ranges,
                     tempo, ..., gemini_assessment, anthropic_api_key, ...)
                     -> list[dict] flags (final, student-facing)
                     (category 4, Claude fusion half; unresolved score measures are suppressed
                     here via NON_SCORE_DEPENDENT_TYPES, not dropped from DTW's input)
```

Confirmed directly in `modal_worker/worker.py`: `run_pitch_tracking` (:884), `dtw_align_to_score` (:2289), `flatten_score_notes` (:1899), `evaluate_with_gemini` (:3669), `compare_and_coach_claude` (:8121, unresolved-measure suppression at :8143-8154).

### What this plan will NOT re-attempt

Per the "stop tuning" decision above, this plan does not propose a sixth variant of the rest-anchor/pitch-jump DTW tuning mechanism. If Task 3's new benchmark reproduces the same bimodal, event-count-ratio-correlated failure on its injected cases, that confirms the existing root cause rather than discovering a new one — report it as confirmation, not as license to start tuning thresholds again.
